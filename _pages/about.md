I'm a Machine Learning Research Leader at [Cohere](https://cohere.com) working on Large Language Models (LLMs). My team's focus is on efficient domain adapation of LLMs in commerical deployments. Prior to joining Cohere, I was the VP of Applied NLP at [LivePerson LPSN](https://www.liveperson.com/).

I obtainted my Masters of Science from NYU where I researched Question Answering systems with [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/) as a member of the [Machine Learning for Language at NYU (ML2)](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) lab which is affiliated with the larger [CILVR lab](http://cilvr.cs.nyu.edu/).
