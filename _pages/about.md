I'm currenlty working on a new project at the intersection of ML/NLP and the energy sector. 

Previously, I lead a team researching efficient domain adaptation methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) at [Cohere](https://cohere.com). Prior to joining Cohere, I was the VP of Applied NLP at [LivePerson LPSN](https://www.liveperson.com/) overseeing applied researchers building conversational systems for global enterprise customers.

I obtainted my Masters of Science from NYU where I researched Question Answering systems with [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/) as a member of the [Machine Learning for Language at NYU (ML2)](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) lab which is affiliated with the larger [CILVR lab](http://cilvr.cs.nyu.edu/).
